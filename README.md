## Prerequisites
- ```Python 3.9``` or higher
- ```Poetry``` (for managing dependencies)
>If you donâ€™t have Poetry installed, you can install it using:  

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```





## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kylejbiron/kyle-tuesday-health-tech-assignment.git
```


2. Install dependencies:  
> Use Poetry to install the project dependencies by running:


```
poetry install
```


3. Activate the virtual environment:
> Once the dependencies are installed, you can activate the Poetry-managed environment:

```
poetry shell
```

> Alternatively, you can run commands directly using poetry run without activating the shell, like this:

```
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files 
```
